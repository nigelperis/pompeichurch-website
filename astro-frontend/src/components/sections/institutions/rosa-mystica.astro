		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			Rosa Mystica High School was opened in the year 1958. As there was no
			facility for the secondary education of the children of this area, they
			had to travel to distant places like Bajpe or Kulshekar. Hence seeing this
			need, Sr Edburge, who was the Headmistress of the TTI, took the bold
			initiative to start a high school to cater to the educational needs of the
			children, especially those who pass out of Rosa Mystica Higher Primary
			School. So, 20th June 1958 became a red-letter day in the annals of Rosa
			Mystica as the High School was opened on this day.
		</p>
		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			In 1966, co-education was started. Rosa Mystica High School, with three
			sections in each, had the strength of 420 students. With the hard work of
			all Headmistresses and the committed services of the staff, the high
			school saw all-round development in the later years. In the year 2008, the
			Golden Jubilee of the school was celebrated.
		</p>
		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			The Headmistresses who served this institute are Sr Edburge BS, Sr Mithis
			BS, Sr Mariette BS, Sr Valentine BS, Sr Mediatrice BS, Sr Helmina BS, Sr
			Donalda BS, Sr Cicilia Mendonca, Sr Marie Ange BS, Sr Gloriosa BS, Sr
			Ivilla BS, Sr Vidya BS, Sr Joyceline BS, and currently Sr Lolita Pereira
			BS.

		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			This institute has special blessings of Saint Teresa of Calcutta, who paid
			a visit to Rosa Mystica on 29th December 1980. In her address, she spoke
			about religious vocation and her concern about the poor in India and our
			duty to serve them.

			all-round development, unmindful of the limited economic resources and
			benefits. Eco club of our college has conducted distinct programs like
			planting medicinal Herbs by reusing plastic bottles to promote the Eco
			friendly environment. Cartoon drawing with the theme of Nature, chart
			making, Essay writing, and the elocution competition. World Environment
			Day was observed to raise global awareness to take positive environmental

			To echo the words of Brigham Young, ‘Education is the power to think
			clearly, the power to act well in the world’s work and the power to
			appreciate life’. We believe that all round development can be achieved
			through education as there is a prime need of striking a balance between
			syllabus, curriculum and co- curricular activities. We look forward with
			hope and greater commitment in this coming year to suffuse the life of
			every student with unlimited potential for incredible growth and learning.
			May Mystical Rose, the model and patroness of our students will enable to
			acquire this life as it is spelt out in its motto.
