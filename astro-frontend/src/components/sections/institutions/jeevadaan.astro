			'Jeevadaan' is their only ray of hope. They know that their life is short
			and society will not accept them as they are infected by the dreaded
			HIV/AIDS virus. They also have no money to live independently and lack the
			strength to work hard. But 'Jeevadan' has created a space for them to live
			a decent life till their death.

			The St Camillus congregation, known for serving the sick and the poor all
			over the world, set up this home for HIV/AIDS patients here in Kaikamba,
			Kinnikambla, located about 20 kms from the city. The nuns decided to serve
			HIV/AIDS patients as it is a fast-spreading disease in the coastal region.

		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			Of the 38 patients here currently, 20 are females and the rest are
			children. The children study at the Rosa Mystica School in Kinnikambla.
			Most women patients here contracted the virus through their husbands.
