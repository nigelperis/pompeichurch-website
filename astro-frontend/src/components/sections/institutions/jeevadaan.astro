      'Jeevadaan' is their only ray of hope. They know that their life is short
      and society will not accept them as they are infected by the dreaded
      HIV/AIDS virus. They also have no money to live independently and lack the
      strength to work hard. But 'Jeevadan' has created a space for them to live
      a decent life till their death.

      The St Camillus congregation, known for serving the sick and the poor all
      over the world, set up this home for HIV/AIDS patients here in Kaikamba,
      Kinnikambla, located about 20 kms from the city. The nuns decided to serve
      HIV/AIDS patients as it is a fast-spreading disease in the coastal region.

      Of the 38 patients here currently, 20 are females and the rest are
      children. The children study at the Rosa Mystica School in Kinnikambla.
      Most women patients here contracted the virus through their husbands.
