			In the quiet heart of Kowdoor, nestled within the embrace of nature, lies
			the cherished legacy of the Bethany Sisters under the mantle of Our Lady
			of Pompei. This is not just a story of a place; it is a story of faith,
			dedication, and a melody of gratitude that resounds through the years,
			honoring God’s unfailing love.
		</p>
		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			Since the year 1965, when Rev. Fr. J.S.T. Rodrigues, then the Parish
			Priest of Pompei Church, envisioned the growth of Pompei Primary School,
			the Bethany Sisters have become an unwavering presence in the lives of
			countless students and families in this rural community. Answering his
			call, Rev. Mother Macrina, Superior General of the Bethany Congregation at
			the time, sent Sr. Patricia, Sr. Florita, and Sr. Susanna to establish
			this new mission of education. With courage and compassion, they began
			sowing the seeds of knowledge, faith, and service—a mission that would
			flourish over the decades.
		</p>
		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			Their presence was a living testament to the power of grace, their
			dedication unwavering even as challenges arose. With each passing year,
			the school became not only a center for education but a beacon of hope.
			Led by the dynamic guidance of Superiors and Headmistresses who succeeded
			them, the Sisters nurtured generations, their teachings backed by the
			strength of their faith. Like a cloud by day and fire by night, the Lord’s
			hand guided their every step, allowing them to make a meaningful impact on
			thousands of lives.
		</p>
		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			Throughout the years, the Sisters’ bond with their students extended far
			beyond the classroom walls. The convent, positioned in the heart of the
			parish, became a sanctuary of powerful spiritual resonance. Here, among
			the rhythms of parish life, the Sisters found both strength and solace,
			partaking actively in all parish activities and enriching the lives of the
			community. Their commitment to education and service shaped not only young
			minds but the spirit of an entire community, creating a lasting legacy
			that reflects the beauty of their purpose.
		</p>
		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			In March 2021, after years of heartfelt service, circumstances required
			the closing of the school under CBE management due to a decrease in
			enrollment. While this brought an end to a chapter, it did not diminish
			the profound impact that the Bethany Sisters left in Kowdoor. Each Sister
			who walked these halls carried a light that will continue to inspire,
			embodying the steadfast love of God and the nurturing presence of Our
			Blessed Mother.
		</p>
		<p class="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-7 text-slate-700">
			As the Bethany Sisters reflect on this journey of faith and dedication, we
			remain unwavering in our commitment to serve. Though the doors of Pompei
			Primary School have closed, our mission endures. Today, we continue to be
			a vital presence in the church through pastoral apostolate—answering the
			urgent call of our times with the same compassion, faith, and devotion
			that have been our foundation for generations. Our legacy of love and
			service shines on as a beacon of hope, guiding us to share God’s grace
			with every heart we touch. May this legacy inspire each of you to embrace
			a life of purpose, service, and profound impact—living for others as we
			walk together in faith.
