        <p class="text-justify leading-7 text-gray-800">
          Earlier, in 1894 AD, seeing the great fruits of this devotion, Pope

        <p class="text-justify leading-7 text-gray-800 mb-6">
          In that church, the Registry of Our Lady of Pompei was used for
          spiritual devotion. Through this registry, countless blessings and
          miracles took place in the surrounding regions, and soon news of these
          wonders spread across the entire world.

        <p class="text-justify leading-7 text-gray-800 mb-6">
          Within our own Diocese, it was the late Rev. Fr. A. J. D'Souza who
          introduced and fostered this devotion to Our Lady of Pompei. During
          that time, registers with the image of Our Lady of Pompei were brought
          from Italy, and one of these reached our Gurpur Parish.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify leading-7 text-gray-800">
          Because of this, and as an honor to Our Lady of Pompei, our parish
          church was solemnly dedicated to her - a fact recorded with official
          testimony.

          Thus, carrying forward more than a century of this sacred history, our
          Gurpur Parish has continued to grow both spiritually and materially.
          The faithful, united in devotion, worked diligently toward the
          development of the parish. Finally, on January 1, 1998, a newly
          designed and beautiful church building dedicated to Our Lady of Pompei
          was blessed and inaugurated - an enduring monument of faith, love, and
          devotion.

              <strong>'Pompeii'</strong> refers to a city of the ancient Roman Empire.
              It is now located in the Campania region of Italy, near the city of
              Naples. In its time, it was a prosperous city filled with grand buildings

            <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-7 mb-4">
              In 79 BCE, this city was completely buried under ash and pumice
              due to the eruption of the nearby Mount Vesuvius. In the 19th
              century, a small Catholic population lived in the villages near
              this place. Devotion was less prevalent among these people. Most
              of the less devout people used to attend Mass at a chapel, that
              is, a small church, located nearby.

              In October 1872, a Catholic named <strong>'Bartolo Longo'</strong>
              visited the village of <strong>'Pompeii'</strong>. He owned some
              land and property there, which he had come to manage. One day,
              while walking on a dusty, deserted road, he heard the voice of an
              unfamiliar woman. There was no one around. The voice said to him:

                Initially, Bartolo faced great difficulty in spreading devotion
                to the Rosary among the people. Nevertheless, he did not give up
                his efforts. Within three years, people began attending daily
                prayers and the Rosary in increasing numbers.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-7 mb-4">
                In 1875, the bishop visited the village of Pompeii and promised
                support to build a new church. Gradually, devotion to "Our Lady
                of Pompei" began to be associated with the Rosary in this
                village.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-7 mb-4">
                Day by day, devotion to Our Lady of Pompei grew, and more and
                more people started gathering. Bartolo and his companions felt
                the need for an image to honor the Virgin Mary during worship.
                So, in October, Bartolo went to Naples to search for an image of
                the Virgin Mary. Despite searching extensively, he could not
                find an image that satisfied him.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-7">
                Finally, with little conviction, he bought an old painting from
                a junk store. (This is the same image we know today as the image
                of Our Lady of Pompei) Everyone liked this painting. From that
                day, with the help of Our Lady of Pompei, many miracles began to
                occur. Her devotion, her miracles, her boundless help, and the
                magnificent temple dedicated to her honor have spread across the
                world. We, the people of Gurpur Parish, are so blessed!

                In memory of the years when Tipu Sultan took the Canara
                Christians into captivity, and about 150 years later, on
                02-04-1934, a large Cross was erected near the church hill. This
                Cross now stands as a reflection and symbol of the Christian

                From the pages of history, on that day, a large number of people
                gathered from Mangalore city for the celebration. The evening
                ceremony began at 4:30 PM on Monday. Rev. Fr. L. Saldanha
                delivered a profound sermon about the Passion of Christ. The
                Cross was carried in a procession from the church to the hill.
                Rev. Fr. Denis Mathias blessed the Cross. Rev. Fr. Louis
                Saldanha led the prayers. A canticle was composed. That day
                marked the beginning of Holy Week. Orders were given to venerate
                the statue of the Cross, the statue of Our Lady of Sorrows, and
                other large statues placed in the church. In 1934, a compound
                wall was built on 2.34 acres of acquired land. In the same year,
                Rev. Fr. Denis Mathias initiated the devotion to the Sacred
                Heart of Jesus at the college, as historical records note.

                For many years, there has been a tradition of blessing the palms
                on Palm Sunday and proceeding to the church in a procession. In
                the centenary year, the path leading to the church hill was
                improved and developed. Arrangements were made to allow
                parishioners to visit, sit, and pray there. In the centenary
                year, the Stations of the Cross were conducted at the site. This
                created an atmosphere of silent prayer for all the parishioners.
