          <p class="text-justify leading-7 text-gray-800">
            Earlier, in 1894 AD, seeing the great fruits of this devotion, Pope Leo XIII placed this miraculous church and the holy place of Pompei under the special care of the Apostolic Church.

            Arrival at Gurpur Parish
          </h2>

          <p class="text-justify leading-7 text-gray-800 mb-6">
            In that church, the Registry of Our Lady of Pompei was used for spiritual devotion. Through this registry, countless blessings and miracles took place in the surrounding regions, and soon news of these wonders spread across the entire world.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify leading-7 text-gray-800 mb-6">
            Within our own Diocese, it was the late Rev. Fr. A. J. D'Souza who introduced and fostered this devotion to Our Lady of Pompei. During that time, registers with the image of Our Lady of Pompei were brought from Italy, and one of these reached our Gurpur Parish.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify leading-7 text-gray-800">
            Because of this, and as an honor to Our Lady of Pompei, our parish church was solemnly dedicated to her - a fact recorded with official testimony.

          <p class="text-justify leading-7 text-gray-800">
            Thus, carrying forward more than a century of this sacred history, our Gurpur Parish has continued to grow both spiritually and materially. The faithful, united in devotion, worked diligently toward the development of the parish. Finally, on January 1, 1998, a newly designed and beautiful church building dedicated to Our Lady of Pompei was blessed and inaugurated - an enduring monument of faith, love, and devotion.

            <strong>'Pompeii'</strong> refers to a city of the ancient Roman Empire. It is now located in the Campania region of Italy, near the city of Naples. In its time, it was a prosperous city filled with grand buildings and all kinds of amenities.

            <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-7 mb-4">
             In 79 BCE, this city was completely buried under ash and pumice due to the eruption of the nearby Mount Vesuvius. In the 19th century, a small Catholic population lived in the villages near this place. Devotion was less prevalent among these people. Most of the less devout people used to attend Mass at a chapel, that is, a small church, located nearby.

            Initially, Bartolo faced great difficulty in spreading devotion to the Rosary among the people. Nevertheless, he did not give up his efforts. Within three years, people began attending daily prayers and the Rosary in increasing numbers.

            <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-7 mb-4">
            In 1875, the bishop visited the village of Pompeii and promised support to build a new church. Gradually, devotion to "Our Lady of Pompei" began to be associated with the Rosary in this village.

            <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-7 mb-4">
            Day by day, devotion to Our Lady of Pompei grew, and more and more people started gathering. Bartolo and his companions felt the need for an image to honor the Virgin Mary during worship. So, in October, Bartolo went to Naples to search for an image of the Virgin Mary. Despite searching extensively, he could not find an image that satisfied him.

            Finally, with little conviction, he bought an old painting from a junk store. (This is the same image we know today as the image of Our Lady of Pompei) Everyone liked this painting. From that day, with the help of Our Lady of Pompei, many miracles began to occur. Her devotion, her miracles, her boundless help, and the magnificent temple dedicated to her honor have spread across the world. We, the people of Gurpur Parish, are so blessed!

            In memory of the years when Tipu Sultan took the Canara Christians into captivity, and about 150 years later, on 02-04-1934, a large Cross was erected near the church hill. This Cross now stands as a reflection and symbol of the Christian faith.

            From the pages of history, on that day, a large number of people gathered from Mangalore city for the celebration. The evening ceremony began at 4:30 PM on Monday. Rev. Fr. L. Saldanha delivered a profound sermon about the Passion of Christ. The Cross was carried in a procession from the church to the hill. Rev. Fr. Denis Mathias blessed the Cross. Rev. Fr. Louis Saldanha led the prayers. A canticle was composed. That day marked the beginning of Holy Week. Orders were given to venerate the statue of the Cross, the statue of Our Lady of Sorrows, and other large statues placed in the church. In 1934, a compound wall was built on 2.34 acres of acquired land. In the same year, Rev. Fr. Denis Mathias initiated the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus at the college, as historical records note.

            For many years, there has been a tradition of blessing the palms on Palm Sunday and proceeding to the church in a procession. In the centenary year, the path leading to the church hill was improved and developed. Arrangements were made to allow parishioners to visit, sit, and pray there. In the centenary year, the Stations of the Cross were conducted at the site. This created an atmosphere of silent prayer for all the parishioners.
