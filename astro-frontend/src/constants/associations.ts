		<strong>In the service of young brothers and sisters</strong><br>

		Under the motto "Service to God through the service of the needy," the first meeting of our association was held on August 16, 1998. The gathering was led by Rev. Fr. Cyprian Pinto, the former parish director, along with Mr Jerald Rasquinha - President, late Mr Jossy D'Lima - Vice President, Mr Jerald Rodrigues - Secretary, and Sister Lucia Jessie Peris - Treasurer. The meeting commenced with the collective effort of members from the parish.<br><br>

		With the spirit of giving in mind, the idea of “giving service to the needy” was expressed. The parish aims to spread kindness and assist in various charitable activities. Mr Jerald Rodrigues, Mr William Tauro, Mr Oswald Peris, and Mr Lancy D’Cunha contributed their services as presidents over the years.<br><br>

		Rev. Fr. Cyprian Pinto inaugurated the association, followed by guidance and advice from Rev. Fr. Paul Rego, Rev. Fr. Gregory Serrao, Rev. Fr. Paul Pinto, Rev. Fr.  Anthony Lobo and Rev. Fr. Rudolph Ravi DSa who provided insights and recommendations.<br><br>

		In 25 years, three new homes have been established. Repairs have been made to 15 homes. Numerous charitable medical camps and health workshops have been organized. Surgical treatments have also been made available through charity and subsidized costs. Efforts for self-employment and financial support have been facilitated. During the Christmas festivities, various programs have taken place, including competitions like crib making focused on enhancing community spirit. Various service projects were initiated during specific holidays. Twice, service programs like community weddings, providing uniforms to children in two schools, have been organised and extended help to those in challenging circumstances. Efforts are made to shelter a few homeless individuals and assist one family by covering their rent debt. Additionally, they consistently visited struggling families, bedridden patients in hospitals, and the sick at home, financial assistance for treatment, and educational support.<br><br>

		It's heartwarming to see how our parishioners have consistently stood by us, offering their support in meaningful ways, even through small contributions.<br><br>

		There has been a continuous effort to engage with the local community and those in need, particularly during times of illness. The primary goal is to maintain connections with families and assist them in their healthcare needs. Continuous support has been provided, ensuring people receive help and guidance when needed.<br><br>

		Meetings were held to discuss plans, and individuals took the opportunity to address community issues and share their experiences. The aim is to create an inclusive environment where all members can feel valued and supported. The meeting is a reflection of the dedication and spirit of service that characterizes our parish community.<br><br>

		During Lent, the association visits the elderly in ashrams with a spirit of compassion. They spend time with priests and elders, making donations. Every week, the parish association gathers, and four times a year, they participate in spiritual retreats in Bajpe. On the feast day of their patron Saint Vincent de Paul, they come together with underprivileged families and supporters to celebrate with generosity. They also pray for the intercession of the society's founder, Blessed Frédéric Ozanam, honouring his legacy.`,

		<strong>Through the youth association: Religious, Cultural, and Social service</strong><br>

		Through the youth association, the talents of young people are encouraged and developed. With the aim of “Religious, Cultural, and Social Service through Youth Associations,” the "Pompei Youngsters Club" (PYC) was officially established in 1973 under the directorship of Rev. Fr.  Gracian D’Souza. In the early years, the youth used to gather under the name “Jolly Club.” Having celebrated its golden jubilee, this association has, since its inception, became a part of the ICYM organization under the Mangalore Diocese, offering its service to both the parish and the community. <br/><br/>

		In 1992, with the support of parish members, the P.Y.C. established a stage and office for cultural activities. Over the years, through schools and other institutions, they have organized various charitable events. The youth actively contributes to church activities, demonstrating their dedication. With public participation, they have provided resources and support for community development. The youth have also participated in competitions in sports, drama, and singing, earning several awards. <br/><br/>

		Today, after 50 years, the P.Y.C. has gained recognition nationally and internationally. P.Y.C. has nurtured many musicians, artists, poets, entrepreneurs, social workers, teachers, and business people who have made significant contributions to society.<br/><br/>

		In addition, the PYC actively participates in religious gatherings of the parish, participating in prayer services, and managing small and large events in the church premises. The association regularly holds events like the Parish Vanamahotsav (tree-planting festival), youth camps, cultural competitions, Christmas Night, carols, annual celebrations, and other traditional activities. Every year, the association also hosts various cultural and social events, including sports tournaments and competitions, bringing in fresh ideas for new events.  The PYC also organizes the “Pompei Cricket League” (PCL), providing an opportunity for everyone to participate in cricket. Each month, the core committee and members meet for discussions. Recognized under the name PYC in the parish and as ICYM Gurpur at the diocesan level, this association plays a significant role in the community and beyond.<br/><br/>

		P.Y.C. youth are also engaged in various recreational activities, providing opportunities for involvement. Directors, animators, presidents, and secretaries work diligently to support the organization. The P.Y.C. continues to be an influential body within the I.C.Y.M. in the region, dedicated to serving the community and enhancing youth engagement.

Their main role is to assist with the Holy Eucharist with devotion, regularly attend Mass, and actively participate in the Holy Sacrifice, especially on Sundays and feast days. After the second Mass on Sundays, they come together as a group to discuss their activities, plan for Mass services, and exchange thoughts on other liturgical duties. Being an altar boy is not just about assisting the priest at the altar during the Holy Sacrifice; it involves participation in other activities like singing, prayers, games, competitions, and picnics, with an effort to contribute to parish activities in every way possible. <br/><br/>

		Initially, the members of the sodality were required to attend Mass regularly and were notified through the notice board during the daily Mass. Whenever there was a death in the parish, they would be expected to visit the family and show support by being present in the church for the final rites. In recent years, female altar servers have also been serving along with the boys, providing their dedicated service to the parish. Even today, the members of the sodality, both male and female, continue to serve with devotion and commitment.`,

As a result of this training, on Sunday, October 29, 2006, in the presence of the parish community, the Women's Organization was established under the motto ‘Women to Live with Dignity and Respect.’ <br/><br/>

		On July 7, 2009, the members of the Women's Forum started a Self-Help Group. This year, there was a focus on understanding social responsibility, entrepreneurship, and the role of women in politics. The Women's Forum inspired the formation of two to three Self-Help Groups in the parish.<br/><br/>
