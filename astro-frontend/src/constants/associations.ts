With the aim of 'Religious, Artistic, and Social Service through Youth Association,' the 'Pompeii Youngsters' Club' (PYC) was established in 1973 under the direction of Fr. Gracian D'Souza. This was the official formation of the parish's oldest youth association. Before this, for a few years, the youth would gather under the name 'Jolly Club.' Now, as PYC completes 48 years, it continues to serve the parish and society, being a part of the Mangalore Diocese's ICYM association. Currently, there are 25 active members in this organization. <br/><br/>

		In 1992, with the support of parishioners, PYC constructed its own stage and office space. In the early years, the youth association distributed books to underprivileged children in local schools, provided financial aid to the needy, and worked on various charitable projects. The youth not only served within the church but also addressed community needs. They installed public water taps for school children, and built water tanks to ensure a supply of drinking water. Additionally, they actively participated in sports competitions, plays, and singing contests, earning several accolades. <br/><br/>

		Over the past 48 years, many former PYC members have gone on to bring honor to the parish both in India and abroad. The organization has nurtured renowned musicians, artists, poets, professionals, entrepreneurs, social workers, teachers, and traders, all of whom stand as a testament to the influence and success of the youth association.`,

Their main role is to assist with the Holy Eucharist with devotion, regularly attend Mass, and actively participate in the Holy Sacrifice, especially on Sundays and feast days. After the second Mass on Sundays, they come together as a group to discuss their activities, plan for Mass services, and exchange thoughts on other liturgical duties. Being an altar boy is not just about assisting the priest at the altar during the Holy Sacrifice; it involves participation in other activities like singing, prayers, games, competitions, and picnics, with an effort to contribute to parish activities in every way possible. <br/><br/>

		Initially, the members of the sodality were required to attend Mass regularly and were notified through the notice board during the daily Mass. Whenever there was a death in the parish, they would be expected to visit the family and show support by being present in the church for the final rites. They also had their own uniform. In recent years, female altar servers have also been serving along with the boys, providing their dedicated service to the parish. Even today, the members of the sodality, both male and female, continue to serve with devotion and commitment.`,

In an effort to make children familiar with the Holy Bible, Christian education on Sundays was based on the Holy Bible. Through the teachings of new concepts to young children and more advanced topics to high school students, efforts were made to instill a love for the Holy Bible and to encourage them to live their lives according to God's word. <br/><br/>

		In the past, the catechists in our parish would teach the children on Sundays. Now, the nuns from the Pompei and Rosa Mystica convents, as well as lay teachers from the parish, are working to impart Christian education to our children. The parish priest encourages the children. Every Sunday during children's Mass, under the guidance of dedicated teachers, the children lead the liturgy. On the first Sunday of the academic year, Christian education is officially inaugurated during the Mass, and on that day, the liturgy is led by the teachers and the children. Every year, on the last Sunday of February, Catechism Day is celebrated. Those who achieve high marks in the catechism exam, and those who attend both the catechism classes and Mass regularly, are awarded by the parish priest. Special recognition is given to the altar servers for their dedicated service. The parish priest honors students who achieve the highest marks in the seventh and tenth-grade catechism exams conducted by the Diocese of Mangalore. <br/><br/>

		Mrs. Irene Pinto served selflessly as the coordinator of Christian education for eight years. Currently, Mrs. Delsy Rodrigues has been serving as the coordinator for the past eight years. Every year, Christian Education Day is celebrated with great enthusiasm at Pompei Sabha Bhavan. Various programs are organized after the classes, and the performances during Catechism Day capture everyone's hearts.

Under the leadership and guidance of the current parish priest, Father Antony Lobo, the community celebrated its Silver Jubilee in grand fashion on February 3, 2019. To ensure the success of the community’s development, the parish organized training and knowledge-sharing sessions both within the ward and at the diocesan level, aiming to lead all the wards together toward a unified direction. They experienced satisfaction through this collective progress. By organizing ward feasts, picnics, entertainment, and voluntary activities, the community was able to build a strong spiritual and social bond. <br/><br/>
