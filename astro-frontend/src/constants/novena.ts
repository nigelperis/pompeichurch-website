<b>Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,</b> that never was it known that anyone who fled to your protection, implored your help, or sought your intercession, was left unaided; inspired by this confidence I fly unto you, O Virgin of virgins my Mother, to you do I come, before you I stand sinful and sorrowful; O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions but in your mercy hear and answer me, Amen.

Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.`;
